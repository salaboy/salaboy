### Salaboy - Open Source Knowledge

I love working on Open Source projects around the Kubernetes ecosystem. I also enjoy a lot sharing what I'm learning with others by talking into conferences and going to events. I am currently working for VMware in the [Knative Project](http://knative.dev) because I am passionate about tools that make our daily life as developers and architects easier.
