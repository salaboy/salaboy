### Salaboy - Open Source Knowledge

I love working on Open Source projects around the Kubernetes ecosystem. I also enjoy a lot sharing what I'm learning with others by talking into conferences and going to events. I am currently working for VMware in the [Knative Project](http://knative.dev) because I am passionate about tools that make our daily life as developers and architects easier.

In the past, I've worked in the field of Business Automation, where I designed and implemented tools related with Business Process Management and Rules/Decision Management. I've also authored books on Workflow engines and extensive documentations about the projects that I've been working on.
