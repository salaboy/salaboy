# Salaboy - Open Source Knowledge

I love working on Open Source projects around the Kubernetes ecosystem. I also enjoy a lot sharing what I'm learning with others by talking into conferences and going to events. I am currently working for [Diagrid](https://diagrid.io) in the[Dapr](https://dapr.io) project. I am also serving as as Steerign Committee member in the [Knative Project](http://knative.dev) as well as working as the Co-Lead of the [Knative Functions](https://github.com/knative/func) project.  

I am currently writing a book titled [Platform Engineering on Kubernetes](http://mng.bz/jjKP?ref=salaboy.com) for [Manning](https://www.manning.com/).
