# Salaboy - Open Source Knowledge

I enjoy working on Open-Source projects within the Java & Kubernetes ecosystems. I also enjoy sharing what I'm learning with others by talking at conferences and going to events. 
I am currently working for [Diagrid](https://diagrid.io) in the [Dapr](https://dapr.io) project. 
I am currently serving as the [Co-Chair of the Developer Experience TAG](https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/main/tags/tag-developer-experience) (Technical Advisory Group) at the CNCF. 

I published a book titled [Platform Engineering on Kubernetes](http://mng.bz/jjKP?ref=salaboy.com) for [Manning](https://www.manning.com/). 

Check the free tutorials and examples from the book in the [Platforms on Kubernetes](https://github.com/salaboy/platforms-on-k8s/) repository.

I am currently writing a book, titled [Developer Experience on Kubernetes](https://www.manning.com/books/developer-experience-on-kubernetes), with my friend @ThomasVitale for [Manning](https://www.manning.com/).
