# KubeCon NA 2022 - Detroit, USA

- [KCP](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp) looks like a great idea but it is still an early prototype, I am definitely getting my hands dirty with this one.
- [Etol Nova](https://www.elotl.co/nova.html) multi cluster federation and scale to zero control planes, unfortunately this is closed source, but worth keeping an eye on. 
- [Crossplane Custom Composition's Design](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/issues/2524) this is getting along, and we should have something by the end of the year. 
- [Crossplane and KCP]() collaborations, the idea is to have a single cluster running Crossplane but managing 1000 clusters who can use crossplane by just binding (`kcp bind`) to a service provider (`kcp export api`) . This will enable to provide Crossplane as a Service.
